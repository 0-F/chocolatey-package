    <summary>PhrozenSoft VirusTotal Uploader is an easy and powerful solution to upload any suspicious file to the official VirusTotal website, and receive the results in real time.</summary>
    <description>VirusTotal is a free service which allows you to scan files using most of the well-known antivirus programs and, because it scans a file simultaneously, it is also called a Multi-Engined Virus Scanner. As VirusTotal is owned by Google, we would like to take the opportunity to thank Google for keeping a such amazing service free. Please note that this software will never replace a real up-to-date antivirus program - It is only another layer of security to protect you and your computer even better against malware, like viruses because it can remove some doubt you might have when you have downloaded a file that you think is suspicious.</description>
